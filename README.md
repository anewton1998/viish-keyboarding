Gnome Shell Extensions
----------------------

By default, Gnome 3 groups applications in the Alt-Tab view when switching from one application to
another. While it is possible to navigate into application groups via the keyboard, it's a bit awkard.
A better solution is the old Alt-Tab behavior of switching between windows instead of application groups.
This can be accomplished with the 
[AlternateTab extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/15/alternatetab/), which is dead simple to install.

Fish
----

Fish is a modern terminal shell that is smart and user-friendly. It's particularly relevant to a vi-workflow
because it offers both enhanced tab-completion and a built-in VI mode. Both of these come default with Fish.

By default, Fish uses Emacs key bindings but switching it to VI mode is simple:

```
fish_vi_key_bindings
```

That will save the bindings for your current session and all future sessions.

In addition, the Oh-My-Fish project comes with a number of themes that are compatible with the VI mode:

* SimpleVi
* Cyan
* BobTheFish
* BudSpencer
* Slavic Cat
* syl20bnr
* tomita
* dangerous

Which you use is a matter of personal preference.  My personal preference is BobTheFish, which can be installed
via the following steps.

1. Install Oh-My-Fish: `curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish`
2. Install the Powerline Font: `sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline`
3. Install BobTheFish: `omf install bobthefish`
